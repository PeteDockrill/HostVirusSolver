An implementation of the host-virus model published in ['*Host–virus evolutionary dynamics with specialist and generalist infection strategies: Bifurcations, bistability, and chaos'*](https://aip.scitation.org/doi/full/10.1063/1.5144875), using a 4th-order Runge-Kutta algorithm to numerically solve the system.
